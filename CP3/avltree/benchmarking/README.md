`avltree.py` - AVL tree implementation.

`ubtree.py` - Basic nonself-balancing binary tree.

`test.py` - Quick unit test to check if the AVL Tree implementation actually self balances when
            adding or deleting stuff.

`benchmark.py` - Script for benchmarking my AVLTree implementation along with an red-black tree
                 and a basic nonself-balancing binary tree. It benchmarks for the time when it's
                 adding and deleting stuff as well as the depth of the tree after adding a bunch
                 of stuff.
