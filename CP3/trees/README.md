# Files

`tree.py` - The Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree.

`test.py` - Unit test to check if the TSBBST implementation actually self-balances when
            you insert or delete stuff.

`interview.py` - Python file where I did the Tree Interview Questions.
                 I used my TSBBST to answer the first interview question because I didn't
                 want to reimplement it by just stripping away the self-balancing stuff
                 included with the delete. It would be the same conceptually...
                 The rotation functions for the last question is also in the TSBBST code
                 under `_ll_rotate()` for right rotation and `_rr_rotate()` for left rotation.
                 I also included some unit testing for the first three questions.
